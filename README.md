The task distribution went smoothly, owing to our familiarity with each other and our experience working together on other projects (past and still ongoing projects). The attached screenshots from our Jira board provide a clearer view of the task allocation, but we can confirm that the workload was evenly distributed among the group members. Gaspard was the main coordinator of the front-end, Lily was the main coordinator of the back-end and Romain was the main coordinator of the presentations and reports. Notice that everyone played a role in every part (Romain and Lily helped for the front end, Gaspard and Romain helped for the back-end and Gaspard and Lily helped for the report and presentation).
